# Monte-Carlo-Mathematics
This project shows that non-deterministic process like Monte Carlo Simulation can be used to approximate values of
expressions that are not non-deterministic (like powers, square roots, definite integrals, logarithmic expressions). MIT OCW's
several lectures were particularly useful for understanding the process and also Toronto University's lecture note about
Monte Carlo Integration helped me a lot.
